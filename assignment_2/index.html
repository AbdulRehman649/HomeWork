    <p>
      Everyone who codes has a <b> favorite language. </b>This happens a lot because we
      studied in a certain programming language, or we grasped it quickly, or it
      made things easier for <br /> 
      <br />
      There are several reasons to having a preferred language. However, our
      language might become drab at times. <b> It is no longer maintained</b> by the
      firm that makes it, or people quit using it for some unexplained reason.
      <br /><br />
      <b> Other languages, such as C,</b> which continues to be the most popular
      programming language in many circumstances, have withstood the test of
      time. <br /><br />
      The point is that programming languages appear to have a life cycle, and
      the end appears to have arrived for some. <br /><br /><br />
      Here are several languages whose future appears to be bleak: <br><br>
      <h2>1. Visual Basic .NET</h2>
      <p>There used to be Visual Basic 6, but Microsoft appears to have wished to do rid
           with it and instead launched the <b> VisualBasic .NET program. </b>
           However, migrating everything to this new version of Visual Basic appears to be 
           an excruciatingly tough operation.There used to be Visual Basic 6, but Microsoft appears to have
            wished to do rid with it and instead launched the VisualBasic .NET program. However, migrating everything 
            to this new version of Visual Basic appears to be an excruciatingly tough operation. <br><br> </p>
           <b> This is notable because, in 1991,</b> Microsoft enhanced the BASIC language by purchasing a graphic designer from
             Alan Cooper to include it into the language. <br><br>
      Cooper used another language at first, but Gates instructed him to change it to BASIC, which the <b> former Microsoft CEO believed</b>
      was the easiest language to learn. <br><br>
       As a result, Visual Basic was formed, ultimately including objects and sophisticated programming techniques. <br><br>
      But then something happened: Anders Hejlsberg, the man in charge of Delphi (at Borland), left the business to join Microsoft,
        where he started the C# project. <br><br>
    This language is similar to Java in many aspects, and after some time, <b> C# became Microsoft’s</b> new language standard. Simultaneously
     with the birth of <b> C#, Microsoft programmers</b> invented VisualBasic .NET, which has the same syntax as BASIC but the code mimics that of C#. <br><br>
     Both languages made their presence known, but C# appears to have won the popularity contest. For this reason, it appears that Visual Basic is condemned to extinction.
<br><br><br>
    </p>
    <h2>2. Delphi</h2>
    <p>Delphi, which is just Pascal plus Objects,<b></b> is most likely on its way out.</b> Embarcadero has attempted to support it, and new versions are still
         being released. Perhaps what transpired was a series of strategic blunders on Borland’s part.
         <br><br>For starters, they <b> changed their name to Imprise for</b>  whatever reason. However, this did not work. They reverted to the previous moniker 
         and abruptly separated their database tools from their programming tools.
        <br><br>
        The latter was renamed CodeGear, but for some reason, people began to suspect that something was wrong: so many name changes, so many strategy
         changes began to <b> drive away its supporters.</b> <br><br>
         It remains to be seen <b> whether Embarcadero’s</b> ongoing efforts can keep Delphi afloat, but it is evident that Delphi is losing favor in the programming world. Perhaps
          it’s time to switch to a different platform. <br><br><br></p>
          <h2>3. Perl</h2>
          <p>
            There was a time when everyone <b> programmed in Perl,</b> but then something occurred. Creators began to pile on more and more powerful features without understanding why.
             Perhaps this added to the complication. <br><br>
             Even its authors appear to have understood <b> (implicitly) that</b> something was wrong with Perl and opted to halt Perl6 development, which began in 2000! The point is that it appears that no one wants Perl any longer. <br><br>
             <br>

          </p>
          <h2>4. Adobe Flash

          </h2>
          <p>We’re not talking about <b> languages here, </b>but about platforms. The death knell for Adobe Flash was probably when Steve Jobs opted not to employ this language in Apple’s mobile devices (at Apple). <br><br>
            If one of the new platforms, <strong> such as the Apple</strong> tablet, does not support Flash apps, developers will be obliged to create them in Javascript, HTML5, or any other platform that Apple will approve. As a result, Flash, despite its continuous progress, began to fade. It is certainly fading today. <br><br><br></p>
            <h2>5. Ruby</h2>
            <p>Ruby was all the rage around <b> 10 years ago. It</b> gained an immediate following after its debut in 1995, and its devotees adored it (and probably still do). Those who grew up with C-like languages, on the other hand, appear to struggle with Ruby. <br><br>
                It is, without a question, <b> a fantastic language,</b> although one that moves slowly due to the fact that it is translated (an issue that strikes me because at this stage of the game making compilers for any language should not be a problem). <br><br>
                Twitter, for example, had many things built <b> in Ruby but abandoned</b> it due to inefficiency, and the day of this revelation was most likely the day when Ruby began to die.

    <h1>Kyle murder case</h1>
    <p>
      Kyle Rittenhouse provoked the fatal shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last
      year by pointing his AR-15-style weapon at Joseph Rosenbaum, prosecutors
      said Monday <i> in closing arguments of his homicide trial</i>. "That is what
      provokes this entire incident," prosecutor Thomas Binger said. "When the
      defendant provokes this incident, he loses the right to self-defense. You
      cannot claim self-defense against a danger you create."

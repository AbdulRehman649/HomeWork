    <h1>Kyle murder case</h1>
    <p>
      Kyle Rittenhouse provoked the fatal shootings in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last
      year by pointing his AR-15-style weapon at Joseph Rosenbaum, prosecutors
      said Monday in closing arguments of his homicide trial. "That is what
      provokes this entire incident," prosecutor Thomas Binger said. "When the
      defendant provokes this incident, he loses the right to self-defense. You
      cannot claim self-defense against a danger you create."

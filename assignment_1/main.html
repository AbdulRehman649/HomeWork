    <h1>No Inventory? No Problem: 17 Low-Investment Small Business Ideas</h1>
    <p>
      he idea of starting a business is exciting. But many ideas require time,
      money, and risk. Contrary to popular belief, there are actually many ways
      to start a business that let you focus less on the logistics and upfront
      costs and more on getting started. <br />
      These low-investment small-business ideas make a great entry point for
      beginners, bootstrappers, or anyone with a busy schedule and let you pick
      up a side business without having to drop everything else.

    <h2>1. Start a dropshipping business</h2>
    <p>
      Buy stock, store it, pick it, pack it, ship it. Managing inventory is a
      big commitment when you’re running a business. Dropshipping is an easy
      business to start and the first of our good business ideas.
      <a href="ds.html">Dropshipping</a>
      is a fulfillment model where a third-party supplier stores and ships
      inventory to customers on your behalf. It’s one of the best businesses to
      start because it’s low overhead, hands-off, and scalable. You don’t need
      to handle any products yourself—you just need to make the sales and pass
      orders on to your supplier. In fact, it’s one of the
      <b>quickest and cheapest</b> businesses to start. You can curate products
      from one or more suppliers into your own online store under a theme that
      focuses on a specific niche, like gear for yoga enthusiasts or
      water(h<sub>2</sub>o ) bowls for dog owners. When a customer buys a
      product from you, the order is sent to your supplier, who fulfills it on
      your behalf. However, you are still responsible for your own marketing and
      customer service.

    <h2>2. Design and sell print-on-demand t-shirts</h2>
    <p>
      Another dropshipping model, print on demand puts inventory, shipping, and
      fulfillment in the hands of a third-party supplier. But unlike the
      dropshipping idea above, the focus here is on customizing products with
      your own designs to create something original. T-shirts, hats,
      <a href="phonec.html">phone cases</a>, hoodies, skirts, tote bags, and
      more become canvases for your creativity. You can think up witty slogans
      for developers or references that resonate with cat owners—if there’s
      passion and pride within a community, there’s a potential t-shirt business
      you can start. Even if you’re not a designer, you can find one to work
      with using freelance sites like Fiverr, Upwork, Dribbble, or 99Designs.
      With many print-on-demand services, you’re paying per product, so the base
      price per unit will be more expensive than if you were to order in bulk.
      But the advantage is that if a certain t-shirt design doesn’t sell, you
      haven’t actually paid for the item yet (only the design, if you outsourced
      it).

    <h2>3. Create an online fashion boutique</h2>
    <p>
      If you love fashion and sharing your sense of style online, you can
      consider creating your own online fashion boutique. You don’t need to
      become a fashion designer—you can simply curate items from other vendors
      into your own online store (using the dropshipping model we discussed
      earlier). Dresses, shoes, swimwear, accessories, and more—you can build
      your own fashion brand using one of the several product sourcing apps for
      Shopify, model them in your own product photos and social media posts, and
      build an online following as a trendsetter.

    <h2>1. Start a dropshipping business</h2>
    <p>
      Buy stock, store it, pick it, pack it, ship it. Managing inventory is a
      big commitment when you’re running a business. Dropshipping is an easy
      business to start and the first of our good business ideas. Dropshipping
      is a fulfillment model where a third-party supplier stores and ships
      inventory to customers on your behalf. It’s one of the best businesses to
      start because it’s low overhead, hands-off, and scalable. You don’t need
      to handle any products yourself—you just need to make the sales and pass
      orders on to your supplier. In fact, it’s one of the quickest and cheapest
      businesses to start. You can curate products from one or more suppliers
      into your own online store under a theme that focuses on a specific niche,
      like gear for yoga enthusiasts or water bowls for dog owners. When a
      customer buys a product from you, the order is sent to your supplier, who
      fulfills it on your behalf. However, you are still responsible for your
      own marketing and customer service.

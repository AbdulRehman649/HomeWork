    <h1>What Is Dropshipping?</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Defining dropshipping</h2>
    <p>
      Dropshipping is an order fulfillment method where a store doesn’t keep the
      products it sells in stock. Instead, the store purchases the item from a
      third-party supplier and has it shipped to the customer. As a result, the
      seller doesn’t have to handle the product directly. The biggest difference
      between dropshipping and the standard retail model is that the selling
      merchant doesn’t stock or own inventory. Instead, the seller purchases
      inventory as needed from a third party—usually a wholesaler or
      manufacturer—to fulfill orders.

    <h2>How does dropshipping work on Shopify?</h2>
    <p>
      Two of the most common approaches for dropshipping on Shopify are to seek
      out a supplier located in North America, or anywhere else in the world,
      using supplier databases or to seek out a Shopify app that connects you
      and your store to thousands of suppliers. For the latter, we recommend
      Oberlo, a marketplace developed by Shopify that helps independent business
      owners find products to sell. With Oberlo, you can browse AliExpress and
      import the products that pique your interest directly to Oberlo—which is
      connected to your Shopify store—with the click of a button. Once a
      customer buys a product, you’ll be able to fulfill their order in the
      Oberlo app. Fortunately, Oberlo automates this process. As the store
      owner, all you have to do is check that the details are correct and click
      the “‘order”’ button. The product is then sent directly from the
      AliExpress dropshipping supplier to the customer—wherever in the world
      they may be.

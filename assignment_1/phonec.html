    <p>
      Mobile devices have taken over the human population. There are 8.5 billion
      mobile device connections around the world, compared to our population of
      7.6 billion people. While this sounds like the start of a sci-fi horror
      film, it’s actually a good sign if you want to create your own phone case
      and accessories to sell online. Custom phone cases, in particular, are
      easy to source and appeal to people who are looking to inject some
      individuality or extra functionality into the one device they can’t live

      A phone case business is a profitable way to make money online. The market
      for phone cases was worth $10 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow 7.5%
      each year until 2025, reaching $35.5 billion. It’s clear there will be no
      lack of customers for your phone case business. Phone cases are also easy
      to handle from a management perspective. They don’t break often, so there
      are fewer returns to deal with. They typically are lightweight and cheap
      to ship and often have decent profit margins. You can find phone cases for
      as little as $5 on a dropshipping site like Oberlo and sell them for
      $10+—an easy 50% profit. The best part? It doesn’t take much upfront
      investment to start a phone case business. You can create an online store
      in minutes, connect it to Oberlo, and go live in a few hours.

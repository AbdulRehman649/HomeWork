    <h2>COVID-19 and people with disabilities</h2>
    <p style="width: 1100px">
      Even under normal circumstances, persons with disabilities—one billion
      people worldwide— are less likely to access health care, education,
      employment and to participate in the community. They are more likely to
      live in poverty, experience higher rates of violence, neglect and abuse,
      and are among the most marginalized in any crisis-affected community. For
      the visually impaired, life under lockdown has posed several issues in
      terms of independence and isolation, especially for people who rely on the
      use of touch to communicate their needs and access information. The
      pandemic has revealed how critically important it is to produce essential
      information in accessible formats, including in Braille and audible
      formats. Otherwise, many persons with disabilities could face a higher
      risk of contamination due to a lack of access of guidelines and
      precautions to protect and reduce the spreading of a pandemic. COVID-19
      has also emphasized the need to intensify all activities related to
      digital accessibility to ensure digital inclusion of all people. During
      the COVID-19 pandemic, many good practices have been implemented by parts
      of the United Nations system to promote a disability-inclusive response to
      the COVID-19 and disseminate information in Braille. In Malawi, the United
      Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has produced 4,050 braille materials
      on awareness and prevention of COVID-19. In Ethiopia, the Office of the
      United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) disseminated
      audio information, and education and communication materials, to media
      professionals, and has developed Braille versions of the educational
      messages. UNICEF has produced guidance notes that are available in
      multiple languages and accessible formats (including Braille and
      ‘easy-to-read’). ‘COVID-19: Considerations for Children and Adults with
      Disabilities’ addresses such issues as access to information; water,
      sanitation and hygiene; health care; education; child protection; and
      mental health and psychosocial support, as well as considerations for an
      inclusive workplace. World Braille Day, celebrated since 2019, is observed
      to raise awareness of the importance of Braille as a means of
      communication in the full realization of the human rights for blind and
      partially sighted people.

    <h2>What is Braille?</h2>
    <p style="width: 1100px">
      Braille is a tactile representation of alphabetic and numerical symbols
      using six dots to represent each letter and number, and even musical,
      mathematical and scientific symbols. Braille (named after its inventor in
      19th century France, Louis Braille) is used by blind and partially sighted
      people to read the same books and periodicals as those printed in a visual
      font. Braille is essential in the context of education, freedom of
      expression and opinion, as well as social inclusion, as reflected in
      article 2 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

          Writing peace... in Braille
        </h3>
        <p>
          "Writing Peace" is a manual that invites young audiences to become
          aware of the interdependence of cultures through familiarization with
          contemporary writing systems, their history, and their mutual
          borrowings. It provides a concrete introduction to many writing
          systems, including Braille.

        <h3>Why do we mark International Days?</h3>
        <p>
          International days and weeks are occasions to educate the public on
          issues of concern, to mobilize political will and resources to address
          global problems, and to celebrate and reinforce achievements of
          humanity. The existence of international days predates the
          establishment of the United Nations, but the UN has embraced them as a
          powerful advocacy tool. We also mark other UN observances.
